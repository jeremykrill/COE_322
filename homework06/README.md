These are the files for Homework 06. The goal here is to deploy the Flask API from the midterm into Kubernetes. Note two styles of filenames- those that have "redis" and those that have "flask" in the names. The "redis" files connect the Redis database to k8s, while the "flask" files connect our animals Flask files from the midterm. The last file, deployment-python-debug.yml allos us to debug our work (steps 1-3 on the HW).
