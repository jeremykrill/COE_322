This is my midterm project for COE 332. It consists of two main segments: a Redis database, and a Flask app. The database stores information about various animals that we've produced over the past semester, such as the animal's name, its number of legs, etc. Each animal also has its own UID and timestamp. The Flask app allows us to pull/modify information from the database so we can manipulate our animals. These two programs are containerized via Docker Compose. To use this program, build the containers using docker-compose build, and use curl to access the Flask app (file known as app.py in the app directory) and play with the data.
